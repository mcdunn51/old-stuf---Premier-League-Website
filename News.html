        <h2>West Ham 0:3 Southampton</h2>
        <div class="container-fluid">

            <div class="justify-text">
                <p>Charlie Austin scored his fifth goal in four appearances as Southampton condemned West Ham to a fourth successive Premier League defeat.</p>

                <p>Austin broke the deadlock in a cagey encounter with a side-foot finish following Ryan Bertrand's pull-back.</p>

                <p>Dusan Tadic made it 2-0, collecting a pass from Austin and rounding Adrian before finding the empty net.</p>

                <p>James Ward-Prowse's low finish consigned West Ham, who had just one shot on target, to defeat.</p>

                <p>The facts are damning for the Hammers. They have lost five of their opening six games in a top-flight season for the first time in their history and are 18th in the table having conceded 16 goals.</p>

                <p>Southampton, meanwhile, have won four matches in a row in all competitions and are up to eighth.</p>

                <p>Having selected a midfield comprising Oriol Romeu, Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and Steven Davis, Southampton's primary aim was to contain while looking to utilise the pace and skill of Nathan Redmond and Tadic on the counter-attack.</p>

                <p>Such a tactic is dependent on the presence of an efficient striker capable of capitalising on relatively few chances, and in Austin the Saints have just that.</p>

                <br>

                <p>The 27-year-old's strike - a well-taken first-time shot from inside the box that found the bottom corner - was the first shot on goal by either team and continued his superb recent form.</p>

                <p>Since making his Premier League debut in August 2014, Austin has scored 21 goals - the same number as Wayne Rooney, despite playing 20 games fewer than the Manchester United and England forward.</p>

                <p>Austin turned provider for the second goal, flicking the ball into the path of Tadic, who made up for wasting two earlier chances by skipping past the onrushing Adrian to wrap up the points.</p>

                <p>Substitute Ward-Prowse added gloss to the display with a neat finish following Davis' driving run and cutback.</p>

                <p>At the other end, Southampton had an equally effective protagonist in Virgil van Dijk, who made 16 clearances, including one on the line to prevent Simone Zaza giving the home side hope.</p>

        <h3>Jose Mourinho: 'I never sold Juan Mata. I need him at Man Utd more than I did at Chelsea'</h3>

        <div class="container-fluid">

                    <div class="justify-text">
                        <p>Juan Mata may have feared for his Manchester United future when Jose Mourinho was appointed, but his manager today assured the Spaniard he is pivotal to the club’s future.</p>

                        <p>Mourinho dismissed the idea that Mata’s long-term prospects were grim because he’d been sold while the Portuguese coach was at Chelsea.</p>    

                        <p>Indeed, the United manager suggested his plans to play a ‘different profile’ of football at Old Trafford compared to Stamford Bridge make Mata a key player.</p>

                        <p>While Chelsea were hailed for being a methodical, defensively sound unit, Mourinho says his ambitions at his new club will evolve the style.</p>

                        <p>“There are big differences,” said Mourinho.</p>

                        <p>“At Man United I have more players to play transitional football. Football is the main objective, we are not so physically strong and compact and playing in a defensive block like we did when we won the title (with Chelsea) in 2014/15,” Mourinho explained.

                            “The football we want to play here is different. We are in the beginning of that process. I think Mata is very adept to do that with his qualities. We need players with these qualities. He has found a very good natural habitat.”</p>

                            <p>When asked to explain why he sold Mata to United for £37.1 million in January 2014, Mourinho shifted responsibility to his former employers.

                                “I didn’t sell him because my job is not to buy and sell,” he said.

                                “My job is to coach and my job is to work on the pitch. My job is to advise my boards on the transfer policy. I don’t buy and I don’t sell and I never did. 

                                “Secondly it was that he was one who asked to leave and when a player asks to leave I think you always have to think twice. The third point is that my idea of football, with the squad I had at Chelsea, with the objectives we had at Chelsea is one thing. The football I want to play at Man United, the profile of my squad and what I want to do in this club is a complete different situation. My project at Chelsea he was a good player, my project at Manchester United is a very good player.”</p>

        <h4>Pogba scores is first goal for United with a dazzling header</h4>

        <div class="container-fluid">    
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-5">

                        <div class="justify-text">

                            <p>Paul Pogba has scored his first-ever goal for Manchester United. The Frenchman directed a bullet header past Ron-Robert Zieler to put United 4-0 up against reigning Premier League champions Leicester on Saturday. His header capped a fine first half for Jose Mourinho's men, who look revitalised after successive league defeats.</p>

                            <p>Pogba had a new midfield partner for the occasion, as Ander Herrera's impressive performance at Northampton earned him a league start alongside the £89million man.</p>

                            <p>In his first spell at United, before leaving for Juventus, Pogba failed to find the net in his seven first-team appearances:he found the net 34 times in his 178 appearances in Italy.</p>

                            <p>Pogba has been criticised for the manner in which he has returned to United, with numerous anonymous performances in the middle of the park.However, a change of shape appears to have allowed Pogba to flourish against Leicester - and he got his just rewards with a goal.

                            <p>Speaking after the game to Sky Sports Pogba said:</p>

                            <p>"I'm very happy for the result and this goal and I hope it's not going to be the last one! "So just carry on, keep doing that, what we did today and after we can go and we have our goals."We were very focused. We knew that was going to be difficult. The first four games we were good, the two games then [against City and Watford] after we knew were going to be difficult, and now today we showed on the pitch a big performance from the team."I feel happy and I want to carry on like ths." </p>

                            <p>
                                Pogba made the score 4-0 after Chris Smalling, Juan Mata and Marcus Rashford all found the net.</p>

                            <p>Before the game, Mourinho revealed that he dropped Wayne Rooney from the starting XI in a bid to add pace to the attack and it paid immediate dividends.</p>

        <h5>Arsenal 3:0 Chelsea</h5>

        <div class="container-fluid">    
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-7">

                        <p>
                            Arsenal produced a devastating first-half display to dismantle Chelsea and secure a fourth successive Premier League win.7
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Alexis Sanchez took advantage of Gary Cahill's error to race clear and lift a composed finish over Thibaut Courtois after 11 minutes, and Theo Walcott completed a brilliant move to steer in Hector Bellerin's pass three minutes later. Mesut Ozil then left N'Golo Kante trailing to expose Chelsea on the counter-attack and steer home Arsenal's third five minutes before the break, after an exchange with Sanchez.</p>

                        <p>
                            It was little more than damage limitation for Chelsea after that as they fell to their second league loss in a row as rampant Arsenal moved third in the table. </p>

                        <p>
                            Arsenal, for all Chelsea's obvious frailties, were simply untouchable from back to front in a magnificent first 45 minutes that revived memories of their finest days. The Gunners showed pace, skill, pressed Chelsea into submission and probed weaknesses ruthlessly in the manner of a team at the top of its game.</p>

                    </div>

                <div class="container-fluid">    
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-md-12">
                            <div id="paragraph-below-Arsenal">
                                <div class="justify-text">

                                    <p>
                                        Arsenal's fans, so often frustrated and having already expressed their discontent at home this season, left Emirates Stadium with a spring in their step and sharing the optimism expressed by manager Arsene Wenger. He wrote in his programme notes: "We feel as though we are on the way up."</p>

                                    <p>
                                        This was a performance that spoke eloquently on behalf of Wenger's theory - with the proviso Gunners fans have heard this talk before only to be disappointed. This, however, was a magnificent exhibition of power, pace and end product, from the skills of Sanchez and Ozil in attack to the lightning speed and tackling of Bellerin at the back. It was as complete an Arsenal performance as they have delivered for some time. Now can they build on the platform laid by this brilliant 90 minutes? </p>
